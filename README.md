To install, clone and look at what `Makefile` does before invoking commands from it.

```
brew cask install iterm2 alfred tunnelblick
brew install cmake
brew install go
brew install vim --replace-system-vi
brew install tmux --HEAD
```

Some of the configs will only work on MacOS with zsh as the native shell.
